# Pending tests in Elixir

When using ExUnit for testing in elixir, you can use the `:skip` tag to
identify tests which do not need to be run.

``` elixir
@tag :skip
test "the truth" do
    assert 1 + 2 == 3
end
```

This test will not be run when using `mix test` and will show up as skipped in
the final statisics.

```
Finished in 1.8 seconds
11 tests, 2 failures, 1 skipped

Randomized with seed 936117
```

Pretty cool right?
