# Redux selectors pattern

Selectors compute derived data. This means that your can use Redux to store the minimal possible representation of the state.

Selectors are composable, meaning that they can and should be used as inputs to other selectors.

``` javascript
/**
 * Given a redux state that looks like this:
 *
 * const state = {
 *   appState: {
 *     button: {
 *       active: false,
 *     },
 *     textArea: {
 *       value: 'Hello world!',
 *       blurred: false,
 *     },
 *     shelf: {
 *       active: "one",
 *       one: {
 *         value: "Yo gabba gabba",
 *         blurred: false,
 *       },
 *       two: {
 *         colour: '#000A89',
 *       }
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 */

// Get the state of the button.
function getButton(state) {
  return state.button;
}

// Using the previous function, get the state
// of the button, then tell me if it is active.
function getButtonIsActive(state) {
  return getButton(state).active;
}

// Get the shelf state.
function getShelf(state) {
  return state.shelf;
}

// Get the active component of the shelf.
//
// This can be computed by first getting the active
// shelf label, then passing it in as a key to the
// shelf state itself.
function getActiveShelf(state) {
  return getShelf(state)[getShelf(state).active];
}
```

## Best practices

Selectors should be co-located with your reducers. Selectors depend on the composition of a certain reducer. Therefore, they inevitably share much of the same knowledge. For those that are familiar with the [CQRS](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CQRS.html) pattern, reducers make up the command model and selectors make up the read model.

``` javascript
function reducer(state = [], action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case: 'ENQUEUE':
            return [...state, action.payload];
        default:
            return state;
    }
}

function getCount(state) {
    state.count;
}
```

## Optimizations

[Reselect](https://github.com/reactjs/reselect) is a library created to improve the read speed of a selector. It is a very basic library which memorizes the selected values and returns them automatically if they are requested multiple times.

This is useful for computed values that require a non-trivial operation. Using the cached value means that it can save times on subsequent accesses without having to re-compute the result.

``` javascript
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'

const getQueueSize = createSelector(
    state,
    state => state.length
)
```
