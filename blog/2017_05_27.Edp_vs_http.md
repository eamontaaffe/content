# Erlang distribution protocol vs Hyper-text transfer protocol

In the past months, my team and I have been building a microservice system based
on Elixir. When building microservices, a common trade-off is speed vs
extensiblility. One example of this is communication between microservices.

Http is the most extensible option, because it can be interpreted by every
language and system out there. However, erlang has an amazing distribution
messaging service (erdp), which will be much more performant when communicating
between elixir/erlang nodes which make up the majority of our system.

We know that erdp will be faster but just how much faster is the question?

## The experiment

### Http server

Use [cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) to setup a basic http server
running a ping application.


### Erdp server

Use genserver to setup a basic http server running a ping application. Connect

## The results
