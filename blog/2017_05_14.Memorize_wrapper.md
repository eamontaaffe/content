# Memorize wrapper

In my previous post, I offered a method for caching properties of long running
functions in python. The pattern works well, however it is
cumbersome to implement and results in a lot of repeated code. In an effort
to [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) out this
pattern, I developed a python wrapper which achieves
the same outcome in a much nicer package.

This time, I am going to show you the code up front, then explain what is going
on. So here it is, this is equivalent to the final Foo example
from the last post:

``` python
import time

def memorize(fn):
    def wrapper(*args):
        self = args[0]
        function_name = fn.__name__
        store_name = "__" + function_name
        if not hasattr(self, store_name):
            setattr(self, store_name, fn(*args))
        return getattr(self, store_name)
    return wrapper

class Bar(object):

    def long_function(self):
        time.sleep(2)
        return 5

    @property
    @memorize
    def result(self):
        return self.long_function()
```

I am going to assume that you are familiar with python wrapper functions, if not
there many [great tutorials](http://simeonfranklin.com/blog/2012/jul/1/
python-decorators-in-12-steps/).

The memorize function is a decorator function which returns a wrapper function.
The since the wrapper function is applied to an instance method, the instance
is passed to it as the first argument, as explained in [this post](http://
stackoverflow.com/questions/11731136/
python-class-method-decorator-w-self-arguments). Once it has access to the
instance, it can create a storage attribute to cache the result of the decorated
function. In subsequent calls, it checks to see if the storage attribute exists
and skips the running of the function a second time if it is able to.
